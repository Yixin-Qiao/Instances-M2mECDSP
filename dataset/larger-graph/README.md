# larger-graph
  the dataset of the GA for Minimum 2-edge Connected M-dominating Set Problem (M(2, m)ECDSP).
  Each file corresponds to one instance. The two numbers in the first line of each file represent the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively. Starting with the second line, each line has two numbers indicating that an edge exists between these two vertices. Every instance is 2-edge connected, which means that a solution to Minimum 2-edge Connected M-dominating Set Problem can be found in every instance.
