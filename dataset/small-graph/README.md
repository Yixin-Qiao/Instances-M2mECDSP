# small-graph

The dataset originates from http://mat.gsia.cmu.edu/COLOR/instances.html.

v30_d10 represents a graph with 30 nodes and an edge density of 10.

The format for each dataset is as follows: the first line contains n, which represents the number of nodes. Each subsequent line contains two numbers, u and v (1 <= u, v <= n), indicating an edge between vertex u and vertex v.

It is guaranteed that a solution for the 2-edge connected dominating set exists for these datasets.

v30-d10 and v30-d20 do not have a 2-edge connected dominating set solution.
