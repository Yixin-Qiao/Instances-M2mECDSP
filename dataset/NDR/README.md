The dataset originates from https://networkrepository.com/networks.php. The datasets listed in the table are used for the GA for the Minimum 2-edge Connected M-dominating Set Problem (M(2, m)ECDSP).

In each dataset, the first row contains two numbers representing the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively. Starting from the second row, each row contains two numbers indicating an edge between the corresponding vertices. The vertex numbering starts from 0. These instances are also 2-edge connected.
